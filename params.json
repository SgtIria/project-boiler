{"name":"Project-boiler","tagline":"Coffee Stylus Jade Riot LoDash NPM Only Browser Sync ","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a simple learning project to create a full stack skeleton project which covered my domain skill set. It really about helping me understand:\r\n\r\n## NPM / Node\r\n1. Multiple build paths (Dev/Prod)\r\n2. NPM Scripts (rather than overweight build tools)\r\n \r\n## Effective workflow paths\r\n1. Managing the flow of changes within the project into destination builds\r\n2. Live reload and continence set-up (we all expect this now)\r\n3. Capturing errors and the resolution cycle\r\n4. Testing \r\n\r\n## Pre Processors (Who need to type more than we already have to)\r\n1. CofeeScript Im still using coffeescript (it works and ES6 feel clumsy atm)\r\n2. Stylus\r\n3. Jade\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n1. Riot JS\r\n2. Q (Promises)\r\n3. LoDash (I just like functional style atm)\r\n4. Jeet (Grid layout assistance)\r\n5. Kyoto (Style mixins)\r\n\r\n## Git\r\n1. Proficiency with git and github \r\n2. Familiarity with github pages system\r\n\r\n## Vim\r\n1 Supportive editor environment, pathogen setup et al.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
